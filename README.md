## Nouns Playable Citizens (NPC)

### Todo

- [] permissions (onlyOwner etc) access... is this handled by rails?
- [] figure out account related business
- [] equip + transfer guard
- [] mint module
- [] deploy scripts
- [] renderer for trait
- [] fees + payment split
- [] contract URI
- [] traits as "trait" of NPC

### Extensions

Extensions extend the capabilities of a core standard. In our case, we extend ERC721 and ERC1155 with metadata rendering logic. Staking might be another example.
OxRails core contracts inherit `extension` which offers us a way to register extensions to the contract.
